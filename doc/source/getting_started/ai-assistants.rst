.. summary-start

Specialized AI helpers for rsyslog tasks: configuration, troubleshooting,
documentation, and development.

.. summary-end

As part of rsyslog’s :doc:`../about/ai_first` strategy, we provide several AI
assistants to make setup, configuration, and contribution easier.  
They are currently implemented as **OpenAI ChatGPT custom GPTs**, which means
you need a free OpenAI account to use them. Most users will find the free tier
sufficient, but availability may depend on your subscription.  
The platform may change in the future.

General-purpose assistant
-------------------------

- **Rsyslog Assistant** – the first stop for all usage, configuration, and
  troubleshooting questions.  
  🌐 https://rsyslog.ai  

  It can generate working config snippets, explain errors, and guide you through
  common tasks. While accuracy is usually high, always **verify the results**.
  Like any AI tool, it can occasionally produce mistakes.

Other assistants
----------------

These are more specialized, and mainly interesting for contributors:

- **Rsyslog Doc Assistant**  
  Helps documentation writers maintain consistent style and structure.  
  🌐 https://www.rsyslog.com/tool_rsyslog-doc-assistant

- **Rsyslog Dev Assistant**  
  For developers, focused on onboarding and codebase exploration. Still
  experimental (as of Sept 2025).  
  🌐 https://www.rsyslog.com/tool_rsyslog-dev-assistant

- **Rsyslog Commit Assistant**  
  Guides developers in crafting commit messages that follow rsyslog’s conventions.
